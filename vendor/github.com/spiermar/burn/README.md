# burn
burn is a CLI tool to convert performance profiles (perf_events, pprof, etc) to hierarchical data structure that can be visualized as [flame graphs](http://www.brendangregg.com/flamegraphs.html), with the help of the [d3-flame-graph](https://github.com/spiermar/d3-flame-graph) plugin. burn can also generate a self contained html flame graphs from the same data.

## Getting Started

Just download _burn_ from github using `go get` or the _pre-build_ binary and use it!

### From go

Make sure you have [golang](https://golang.org/) installed and `GOPATH` correctly set.

```bash
$ go get github.com/spiermar/burn
$ burn $GOPATH/src/github.com/spiermar/burn/examples/out.perf
```

### From binary

Binaries are being provided for both `linux` and `darwin`, in `amd64` arch.

```bash
$ curl -L "https://dl.bintray.com/mspier/binaries/burn/1.0.1/darwin/amd64/burn" -o burn
$ chmod +x burn
$ ./burn <input_file>
```

#### linux/amd64

```bash
$ curl -L "https://dl.bintray.com/mspier/binaries/burn/1.0.1/linux/amd64/burn" -o burn
$ chmod +x burn
$ ./burn <input_file>
```

## Options

```
$ burn convert --help

Convert a performance profile to a hierarchical data structure that
can be visualized as a flame graph.

Examples:
  burn convert examples/out.perf
  burn convert --type=folded examples/out.perf-folded
  burn convert --html examples/out.perf
  burn convert --output=flame.json examples/out.perf
  burn convert --html --output=flame.html examples/out.perf
  perf script | burn convert --html

Usage:
  burn convert [flags] (<input>)

Flags:
  -h, --help            help for convert
  -m, --html            output is a html flame graph
      --output string   output file
  -p, --pretty          json output is pretty printed
      --type string     input type (default "perf")

Global Flags:
      --config string       config file (default is $HOME/.burn.yaml)
      --cpuprofile string   write CPU profile to file
      --memprofile string   write heap profile to file
```

## Examples

Input and output examples can be found in the [examples](/examples) directory.

## Building from source

```bash
$ go get github.com/spiermar/burn
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/spiermar/burn
